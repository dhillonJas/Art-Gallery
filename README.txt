	all are cited in a different txt file 'citations.txt' in assets folder

	The main feature included is interactivity with the tree
	while standing in front of the tree (marked with a green line) and the closest you can 
	get, clicks on the trunk will change speed of the lighting on the tree.
	
	a click on the first leaf (triangle above trunk, only the bottom visible part) will start
	fireworks from the tree, another click will disable it.
	
	a click on the second leaf will move the tree away and clear the space to walk, the tree will
	be now a sticker on the wall and the tree can be brought again by clicking on that sticker (be 
	as close to the wall you can get)


	Another feature included is over-the-shoulder 
	press space to show the avatar and again to make it go away
	this feature is a little buggy as the character sometimes goes through exhibits
	also, the interactivity part does not work if this feature is enabled
